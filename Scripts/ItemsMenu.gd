# Six item cards are defined entirely in the scene (ItemsMenu.tscn).

# that item's icon, name, type, and description.
# "← Back to Items" hides the overlay and returns to the card grid.
# Stats/effects are intentionally omitted for now (coming soon label shown).

# Item data — description is the only dynamic field needed per card.
# Name, type, and icon are already set as Label text in the scene.
